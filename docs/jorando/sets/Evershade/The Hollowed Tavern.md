Once the hear.  of the village, the Hollowed Tavern was a place of warmth, drink, and stories. Now, it stands as a rotting husk of itself—its wooden beams swollen with moisture, the hearth cold, and chairs collapsed in disuse. Yet the air here feels thicker, heavier, as if memory itself lingers like smoke. Sometimes, on the edge of hearing, the crack of a tankard or the lilt of a love song flickers through the silence.

**Trap / Hazard / Encounter:**  
Inside the tavern, the spirits of the dead villagers occasionally **replay their final moments** in spectral echoes—reliving laughter, arguments, confessions, or deaths. These **Residual Echoes** can cause disorientation or even possession if approached carelessly.

- **Spectral Loop**: A patron at the hearth relives his final toast every night. If you step into the circle, you feel a deep chill, and must pass a Willpower check or relive his final regret (gain 1 Ruin).

- **Glass Shard Trap**: Beneath the broken bar lies a shattered mirror. If uncovered, it reveals a twisted reflection of whoever looks into it—showing a version of you who _never left Evershade_. Passing a resolve check lets you gain insight into the village’s collapse. Failing causes despair (-1 on next roll).

**Opportunity / Treasure / Cool Thing:**

- **Censer of Lament**: Hanging in a charred alcove near the hearth, this rusted brass censer can still be lit. When filled with the right herbs, it **calms spirits** within the area but **induces sorrowful visions** in those who carry it.

- **Bottle of Salted Flame**: Behind the bar lies a sealed bottle of spirit made from lakewater and rare herbs. When drunk, it restores 1 Use of a magical item or allows one reroll on a failed spell, but causes momentary memory loss.

- **Old Registry Book**: A mold-ridden ledger listing the names of travelers who passed through before the fall. If your name is written in it (or appears mysteriously), the spirits recognize you as a friend—changing how encounters unfold within the tavern and graveyard. May also contain a clue about Alaric or Liora.
