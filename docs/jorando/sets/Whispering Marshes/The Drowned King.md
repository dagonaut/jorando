Endurance 10
#### Description:
* Once a noble ruler of Kalduhr, the Drowned King came to Jorando to atone for his sins, but it was too late and he was cursed by the gods for his hubris and now wanders the marshes, his body bloated and twisted by the waters that claimed his life. His body is bloated and twisted, adorned in tattered, waterlogged finery. His crown, a symbol of lost glory, is rusted and fused to his skull. He drags a massive sword covered in Marrow Cling that seems impossibly heavy, but he wields it with terrifying ease. His eyes glow with a sickly green light, and the air around him is filled with the stench of decay.

#### Lore:
- Legends tell of the Drowned King’s hubris during the **Sundering**. Seeking forbidden power, he attempted a ritual that failed catastrophically, binding him to the marsh as a tragic, cursed figure. His presence is said to ensure no one disturbs the dark secrets buried in the heart of the marsh.

#### Abilities:
* Attack: **Drowned Strike** – The Drowned King swings his massive sword in a wide arc, dealing heavy damage to all players in front of him. Those who fail to dodge are knocked back into the murky waters, risking being pulled down by The Drowned Dead.

* Special: **Corrosive Breath** – He exhales a cloud of toxic mist that corrodes armor and weapons, reducing their effectiveness. Players must cleanse themselves with an antidote or suffer ongoing damage.

* Special: **Tidal Wrath** – Summons waves of murky water, slowing movement and calling forth [[The Drowned Dead]] minions to assist him.

* Special: **Aura of Despair** – Players within close range must pass a [[Risk Roll]] to resist overwhelming sorrow, reducing their combat effectiveness.

* <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Weakness</span>: **Light of the Ancients** – The Drowned King is vulnerable to radiant or holy light. Players can find an ancient lantern in the Whispering Marshes that, when combined with the [[Priests Jaw Bone]] & lit, weakens his endurance by 4
#### Treasures:
- **Crown of the Drowned King (Helm)** – A rusted crown that grants the wearer resistance to poison and disease, but slowly drains their vitality.
- **Sword of the Sunken Empire (Weapon)** – A heavy, two-handed sword with the power to summon waves of water with each swing. It deals extra damage to fire-based enemies.
