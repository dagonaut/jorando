*A gnarled staff made from the wood of ancient, waterlogged trees. It grants the user increased control over water-based magic but is fragile and prone to breaking.*

*"Handle it with careâ€”once broken, its magic will flow away like the tide."*

**Effect:** Adds 1 white die to Ritual rolls. Lost if Ruin is taken.
