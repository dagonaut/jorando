*A lantern filled with glowing moss that thrives in the marshes. It provides dim light and can be used to reveal hidden paths, but the glow attracts creatures of the swamp.*

*"Keep it lit, traveler—but don’t let the glow fool you. In the marsh, what sees you is worse than what you see."*

*"Its light cannot be hidden, nor can it hide."*

**Effect:** Can find hidden paths/treasure (when in use, allows treasure to be found even on failure)

**Effect:** When combined with the [[Priests Jaw Bone]] it weakens the defense of the Drowned King (-4).
