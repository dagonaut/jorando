**SET: THE CISTERN BENEATH THE RUINED CHURCH OF THE HOLLOWED SAINTS**

---

### üìú Intro

Beneath the cracked stone floors of the Ruined Church lies the cistern: a once-holy chamber now drowned in sanctified corruption. Carved into the earth as a reservoir for sacred water, the cistern was once blessed by the Hollowed Saints themselves. Pilgrims would descend to draw healing waters, believed to protect against grief and disease. But with the taint of the Lake of Tears, that purity twisted. The water grew still, heavy with sorrow. Saints wept into the pool, and their despair rooted into the stone. Now the cistern reflects not grace, but grief, a mirror to the fall of faith.

### üéØ Goal

- **Objective**: Reach the depths of the cistern and cleanse or claim its heart.
- **Discover**: What became of the final saints who performed the forbidden rites.
- **Complication**: Any who touch the water risk the slow onset of the Hollowing Curse.

### üîî Moments

- A whisper travels across the water, repeating something only one character knows.
- A tear falls from a crack in the ceiling, sizzling on the stone.
- A broken mask floats on the surface of the cistern.

### ‚ùì Questions

- What pain would you trade away if you could?
- Who among you carries a vial of the church's water from before it was corrupted?
