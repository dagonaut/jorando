**SET: THE CISTERN BENEATH THE RUINED CHURCH OF THE HOLLOWED SAINTS**

---

### 📜 Intro

Once a sacred reservoir beneath the church, the cistern stored water said to cleanse the soul and ward off darkness. Now, after centuries of corruption, it holds only sorrow. The Lake of Tears seeped into its depths, warping the holy water and transforming the cistern into a vessel of grief and memory. Saints once purified pilgrims here; now they whisper curses in the dark. The space echoes with the burden of centuries, soaked in both sanctity and despair.

### 🎯 Goal

### 🔔 Moments

### ❓ Questions
- What memory returns to you when you see your reflection here?
